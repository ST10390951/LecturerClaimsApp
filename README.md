Lecturer Claims Web Application
Overview
The Lecturer Claims Web Application is designed to provide a streamlined experience for lecturers and program coordinators/managers to handle work-related claims. Lecturers can submit claims for approval, while managers can review, approve, or reject these claims. The application is user-friendly with a bright blue color scheme, providing a welcoming and easy-to-navigate interface.

Features
